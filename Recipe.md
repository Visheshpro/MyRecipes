Making the pastry


First, make the pastry. Pulse the flour and icing sugar with the salt in a food processor. Add the butter and pulse to a fine breadcrumb-like consistency, then add the orange zest. Whisk together the egg and orange juice; pour into the food processor while pulsing until it starts to clump together.

Tip onto a clean surface; bring together with your hands. Shape into a flat disc. Wrap in clingfilm; chill for 30 mins. Cut off one-third of the pastry; rewrap and return to the fridge.

Roll out the remaining two-thirds on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a pound coin, then press into a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin (about 3.5cm deep). Trim around the tart tin to cut away excess pastry. Prick the base all over with a fork; chill for 20 mins.

Preheat a baking sheet in the oven to gas 6, 200째C, fan 180째C. Line the pastry with baking paper and fill with baking beans. Blind- bake on the preheated baking sheet for 20 mins. Remove the paper and beans, then bake for 5 mins more.


Plaiting the pastry


Roll out the remaining one-third pastry to the thickness of a pound coin and into a square of about 30cm. Using a ruler and a sharp knife, cut out 2 x 2cm-wide strips and 12 x 1cm-wide strips. Use 9 of the 1cm-wide strips to make 3 plaits. To plait, place 3 of the 1cm strips vertically, close together.

Working from the outside, lift 1 strip of pastry over the central strip, moving the central strip aside. Alternate from left to right, keeping an even tension until the plait is formed, then transfer to a lined baking sheet. Cover; chill until needed.


Building the lattice


Meanwhile, warm the syrup, marmalade and ginger in a large saucepan until smooth and just starting to bubble. Set aside to cool for 5 mins, then slowly whisk in the eggs and cream. Add the oats, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and juice. Reduce the oven to gas 4, 180째C, fan 160째C.

First arrange all the vertical strips of pastry, leaving plenty of overhang. Weave the horizontal strips, one at a time, from one side of the tart to the other, alternating laying them over and threading them under the vertical strips.


Finishing the lattice


Pour the filling into the pastry case. Working quickly, lay the pastry strips and plaits over the filling, weaving in and out. Bake the tart with the lengths of the lattice strips hanging over the tart tin, as the pastry may shrink while baking.


Glazing the tart


Brush the edge of the pastry case and all decorations with beaten egg yolk. Glazing the pastry with egg yolk before baking will ensure an even, golden finish and shine.

For more wow-factor, melt an extra 1 tbsp marmalade in a saucepan over a low heat: brush over the baked tart for a super-glossy finish.


Baking the tart


Bake for 30-35 mins until golden and crisp. Once cooked, trim away the excess pastry with a sharp knife.

Leave in the tin for 15 mins to cool before carefully removing then enjoy your tart.
